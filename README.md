# Bamazon

This activity was for week 12 of my Penn Boot Camp coursework. This week's challenge was to create an Amazon-like store that allows customers to place orders, and depletes the stock quantity as the orders are successfully filled. There's also a manager console that allows users to view what is on sale, check which items are about to run out, and add additional inventory to an item, and add a brand new item for sale. Supervisors can track product sales across departments and see which departments are making the most money.
